    "Kentwood electronics is interested in marketing its business in the Chicagoland area. It is considering three alternatives: TV, radio, and internet. Kentwood electronics has estimated the number of audience reached per ad, the cost per ad, and the maximum number of ads allowed. This information is reported in the following table:\n",

    "The number of each type of media used should not exceed the maximum usage count;\n",
    "Total cost of ads should be less than the available budget of $18,000.\n",
    "To balance the use of advertising types, television usage must not exceed 50% of the total number authorized, and the internet ads should account for at least 10%.\n",

    "Please answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Write down a formulation for this optimization problem. Please define and explain the objective function, decision variables, and the constraints in your formulation.\n",
    "2. Identify whether your formulation is a linear program, an integer program, or a mixed-integer program.\n",
    "3. Write Python code to solve the model using Gurobi.\n",
    "4. Report the optimal solution and the optimal value (optimal audience reached) obtained from Gurobi. Also, report the Gurobi runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Report Gurobi output. Look at this output and comment on the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1. What is the size of the model after presolve? \n",
    "\n",
    "5.2. Does Gurobi spend most of its time improving the feasible solution or improving the upper bound?\n",
