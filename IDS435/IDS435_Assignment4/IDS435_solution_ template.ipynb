We also reviewed accompanying Python code to solve this problem using Gurobi and analyze the output. See \"electrical_power_1_gcl_code.ipynb\". The assignment requires you to account for new developments regarding available generators. In addition to the thermal generators in the previous problem, two new Hydro-power generators have become available, each with a fixed power output (when on):\n",

The real cost for a hydroelectric plant comes from depletion of the water in the reservoir, which happens at different rates for the two units. The reservoir must be replenished before the end of the time horizon by pumping water into it, which consumes electricity. A hydroelectric plant also has a startup cost.\n",
